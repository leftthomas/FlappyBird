# FlappyBird

This is a simple game made in a pure functional programming language —— [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

To run the game, you must have Cabal installed in your OS. You can get it by installing the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/). 

# Usage
## OS X
```
git clone https://github.com/leftthomas/FlappyBird.git
cd FlappyBird
stack build
stack exec FlappyBird
```
The game has 3 levels. You are going to level up each at score 5, 10 and 15.

Controls: Press the up arrow key to control the bird and to pass the menu scenes.
## Ubuntu 16.04
### Step 1: Clone && build && exec
